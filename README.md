# Laravel Package Registry
This library contains a registry of the core Laravel and popular community package dependencies. It is used and maintained by [Laravel Shift](https://laravelshift.com).

## Contributing
You are welcome to open a _Pull Request_ to add functionality to the `Registry` class. However, the registry itself is autogenerated by _Shift_ on a weekly basis. If you notice an issue with one of the constraints or would like to add a package to the registry, please [open an issue](https://github.com/laravel-shift/package-registry/issues).
